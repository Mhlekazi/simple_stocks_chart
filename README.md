# simple_stocks_chart
This is a simple stocks webapp built on streamlit. I have attached the snipped image from the browser. Just exploring different ways to building webapps with a datascience feel to them. 

Remeber to install streamlit and yfinance.

I have also included a requirements.txt for those who would want to

pip install -r requirements.txt


remember that to run the app use:streamlit run stocks.py  from the command prompt
